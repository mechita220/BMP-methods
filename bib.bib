	abstract = {Accurate determination of biochemical methane potential (BMP) is important for both biogas research and practice. However, access to laboratory equipment limits the capacity of small laboratories or biogas plants to conduct reliable BMP assays, especially in low- and middle-income countries. This paper describes the development and validation of a new gas density-based method for measuring BMP (GD-BMP). In the GD-BMP method, biogas composition is determined from biogas density. Biogas density is based on bottle mass loss and biogas volume, and these can be accurately measured using only a standard laboratory scale, inexpensive syringes, and a simple manometer. Results from four experiments carried out in three different laboratories showed that the GD-BMP method is both accurate (no significant bias compared to gravimetric or volumetric methods with biogas analysis by gas chromatography) and precise (\&lt;3\% relative standard deviation is possible). BMP values from the GD-BMP method were also comparable to those measured for the same substrates with an industry standard automated system (AMPTS II) in two independent laboratories (maximum difference 10\%). Additionally, the GD-BMP method was shown to be accurate even in the presence of leakage by excluding leakage from mass loss measurements. The proposed GD-BMP method represents a significant breakthrough for both biogas research and the industry. With it, accurate BMP measurement is possible with only a minimal investment in supplies and equipment.},

	abstract = {This work presents a gravimetric method for measuring biogas or methane production from anaerobic reactors, based on measurement of reactor mass loss. Results are most sensitive to error in biogas methane content, and less so to temperature and pressure. To evaluate the method, we applied it and volumetric methods to 133 laboratory-scale batch and semi-continuous reactors, ranging in size from 37~g to 8.0~kg of reacting mass. For most observations, the relative difference between the two methods was \&lt;10\% when the {\textquotedblleft}true{\textquotedblright} biogas composition was used in calculations. Small systematic differences observed in some cases were probably due to error in estimates of biogas pressure, temperature, and composition, as well as biogas leakage. Based on theory and observation, it is reasonable to expect relative accuracy better than 15\% of the true value.},

	isbn = {978-1-4200-5663-1},
	abstract = {Two critical questions arise when one is confronted with a new problem that involves the collection and analysis of data. How will the use of statistics help solve this problem? Which techniques should be used? Statistics for Environmental Engineers, Second Edition helps environmental science and engineering students answer these questions when the goal is to understand and design systems for environmental protection. The second edition of this bestseller is a solutions-oriented text that encourages students to view statistics as a problem-solving tool. Written in an easy-to-understand style, Statistics for Environmental Engineers, Second Edition consists of 54 short, "stand-alone" chapters. All chapters address a particular environmental problem or statistical technique and are written in a manner that permits each chapter to be studied independently and in any order. Chapters are organized around specific case studies, beginning with brief discussions of the appropriate methodologies, followed by analysis of the case study examples, and ending with comments on the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches. New to this edition:Thirteen new chapters dealing with topics such as experimental design, sizing experiments, tolerance and prediction intervals, time-series modeling and forecasting, transfer function models, weighted least squares, laboratory quality assurance, and specialized control chartsExercises for classroom use or self-study in each chapterImproved graphicsRevisions to all chaptersWhether the topic is displaying data, t-tests, mechanistic model building, nonlinear least squares, confidence intervals, regression, or experimental design, the context is always familiar to environmental scientists and engineers. Case studies are drawn from censored data, detection limits, regulatory standards, treatment plant performance, sampling and measurement errors, hazardous waste, and much more. This revision of a classic text serves as an ideal textbook for students and a valuable reference for any environmental professional working with numbers.},

In some cases, assumptions implicit in kinetic analysis techniques developed for conventional dilute digestion modes are not applicable to systems operating at high rates and/or high solids concentrations. As a result, modified definitions are presented for CST digester retention times and first order kinetic coefficients. Procedures are presented for converting biogas data to standard conditions. Two novel methods for quantifying mass removals, based on direct measurement of reactor mass losses and on biogas production, allow rapid determination of mass removal rates and detection of gas leakage. The use of a per unit mass basis for reporting concentrations and kinetics is recommended.},
