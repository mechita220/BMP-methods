  abstract = {Two critical questions arise when one is confronted with a new problem that involves the collection and analysis of data. How will the use of statistics help solve this problem? Which techniques should be used? Statistics for Environmental Engineers, Second Edition helps environmental science and engineering students answer these questions when the goal is to understand and design systems for environmental protection. The second edition of this bestseller is a solutions-oriented text that encourages students to view statistics as a problem-solving tool. Written in an easy-to-understand style, Statistics for Environmental Engineers, Second Edition consists of 54 short, "stand-alone" chapters. All chapters address a particular environmental problem or statistical technique and are written in a manner that permits each chapter to be studied independently and in any order. Chapters are organized around specific case studies, beginning with brief discussions of the appropriate methodologies, followed by analysis of the case study examples, and ending with comments on the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches. New to this edition:Thirteen new chapters dealing with topics such as experimental design, sizing experiments, tolerance and prediction intervals, time-series modeling and forecasting, transfer function models, weighted least squares, laboratory quality assurance, and specialized control chartsExercises for classroom use or self-study in each chapterImproved graphicsRevisions to all chaptersWhether the topic is displaying data, t-tests, mechanistic model building, nonlinear least squares, confidence intervals, regression, or experimental design, the context is always familiar to environmental scientists and engineers. Case studies are drawn from censored data, detection limits, regulatory standards, treatment plant performance, sampling and measurement errors, hazardous waste, and much more. This revision of a classic text serves as an ideal textbook for students and a valuable reference for any environmental professional working with numbers.},

Additionally, methane potential can be predicted from substrate composition, facilitating experimental design and interpretation of results.

  abstract = {This work focused on identification and quantification of systematic sources of error in manometric measurement of biochemical methane potential (BMP). Error was determined by comparison to gravimetric measurements and direct measurement of leakage. One out of three types of septa leaked above 1 bar (gauge) headspace pressure, losing 25 to 30\% of biogas produced. But manometric BMP showed a negative bias even in the absence of leakage. Maximum error was 24\% from 160 mL bottles with 40 mL of headspace (headspace fraction of 0.25). Error decreased with increasing headspace fraction, and was small (3\%) for a headspace fraction of 0.75, showing that a high headspace volume is the best approach for minimizing error. Relative error in CH4 production measurement increased with headspace pressure as well, but controlling pressure alone is not sufficient for minimizing error. Calculations showed that observed error may be due to volatilization of CH4 during venting as well as inaccurate headspace volume determination, although these sources do not completely explain the magnitude of error observed. Measurement of biogas composition before and after venting showed that CO2 volatilization can occur, but is probably a minor source of error. Calculations showed that error in estimation of ambient pressure or headspace temperature had only minor effects ({$<$}3\%). Gravimetric measurements, which were unaffected by leakage and insensitive to error in estimation of headspace pressure, temperature or volume, can provide a simple check on manometric results, or a complete replacement.},

Results are most sensitive to error in biogas methane content, and less so to temperature and pressure. To evaluate the method, we applied it and volumetric methods to 133 laboratory-scale batch and semi-continuous reactors, ranging in size from 37~g to 8.0~kg of reacting mass. For most observations, the relative difference between the two methods was \&lt;10\% when the ``true'' biogas composition was used in calculations. Small systematic differences observed in some cases were probably due to error in estimates of biogas pressure, temperature, and composition, as well as biogas leakage. Based on theory and observation, it is reasonable to expect relative accuracy better than 15\% of the true value.},

  abstract = {Accurate determination of biochemical methane potential (BMP) is important for both biogas research and practice. However, access to laboratory equipment limits the capacity of small laboratories or biogas plants to conduct reliable BMP assays, especially in low- and middle-income countries. This paper describes the development and validation of a new gas density-based method for measuring BMP (GD-BMP). In the GD-BMP method, biogas composition is determined from biogas density. Biogas density is based on bottle mass loss and biogas volume, and these can be accurately measured using only a standard laboratory scale, inexpensive syringes, and a simple manometer. Results from four experiments carried out in three different laboratories showed that the GD-BMP method is both accurate (no significant bias compared to gravimetric or volumetric methods with biogas analysis by gas chromatography) and precise (\&lt;3\% relative standard deviation is possible). BMP values from the GD-BMP method were also comparable to those measured for the same substrates with an industry standard automated system (AMPTS II) in two independent laboratories (maximum difference 10\%). Additionally, the GD-BMP method was shown to be accurate even in the presence of leakage by excluding leakage from mass loss measurements. The proposed GD-BMP method represents a significant breakthrough for both biogas research and the industry. With it, accurate BMP measurement is possible with only a minimal investment in supplies and equipment.},

Two novel methods for quantifying mass removals, based on direct measurement of reactor mass losses and on biogas production, allow rapid determination of mass removal rates and detection of gas leakage.
